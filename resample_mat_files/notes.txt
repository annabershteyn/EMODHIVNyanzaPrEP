Three different independent calibrations of Nyanza are available here.
Two test opposing assumptions about the residency of the male clients of FSW in the counties were FSW are enumerated.
Details of these calibrations are available here:

I performed 64 iterations of PSPO for non-resident, 59 for resident.
The third calibration limits condom usage rates to 30% for married, 40% for informal, and 50% for transitory partnerships to limit the extent to which the model relies on condom usage increases to reduce incidence/prevalence.
That calibration produced a smaller, more risky high-risk core group.
